## Reason why I made this Weather-Dashboard

I created this to display weather for any given city.
It also display date for which its diplaying the weather and also images displays immages of weather in the cards provided.
The purpose is to mainly gather weather inforamation from an API and represent them back to the user.

## What I learned
I learned fetch calls and promises while devoloping this application I also got learneed how to call functions and return values. I also learned to store data in local storage in retrive this back. This is the most important task I learned doing this.

## Challalanges
At first I was I had difficulty in fetching data from an API. When I finally fetched data , it was hor for me to read that data. Then I had problem with storing then into local storage and fetching them back.
But finally I was able to overcome this difficulty and overcome this.
